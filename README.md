# Life Loading Simulator

A philosophical, minimalist web experience that simulates the perpetual state of waiting and becoming.

## Concept

"Life is loading…"

This is not a joke app. It is a reflection on the human condition. We are constantly in a state of preparation, optimization, and waiting for the "right moment". We expect a clean 100% completion, but life is messy, non-linear, and never truly "done".

The interface is brutalist, dark, and calm. It invites the user to stop scrolling and simply exist in the discomfort of the incomplete.

## Why it never reaches 100%

The loading bar is designed to never hit 100%. It is asymptotically close but forever out of reach.

- **Unpredictability:** Progress is not linear. It jumps, pauses, and sometimes regresses, mirroring real-life progress.
- **The limit:** It is capped at 97%.
- **The message:** There is no final destination. The process itself is the experience.
